#Loss Function 

Loss function (also known as cost function or an error function) specifies a penalty for an incorrect estimate from a statistical or machine learning model. Typical loss functions might specify the penalty as a function of the difference between the estimate and the true value, or simply as a binary value depending on whether the estimate is accurate within a certain range. 

This code is useful to build loss functions using simulated data. A detailed write up onn "Loss Function" is to be found in our book chapter to be published by Springer in the book named as "Encyclopedia of Mathematical Geosciences".
